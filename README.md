# Exercises from Le Wagon Data Science & AI bootcamp January-March 2024 📓🤖
This repository gathers notebooks and code from some of the exercises I completed as part of the [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon) Data Science & AI bootcamp in January-March 2024.

For the more compute-heavy Deep Learning exercises, I typically worked directly in Google Colab instead of running notebooks on my own machine. At the point of writing those notebooks are not present in this in this repo.
