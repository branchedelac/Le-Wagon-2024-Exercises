# Le Wagon Data Science & AI bootcamp January-March 2024
This repository gathers notebooks and code from some of the exercises I completed as part of the Le Wagon Data Science & AI bootcamp January-March 2024.
For the more computing heavy Deep Learning exercises, I typically worked directly in Google Colab instead of running notebooks on my own machine. At the point of writing those notebooks are not present in this in this repo.
